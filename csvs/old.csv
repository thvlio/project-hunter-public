smart culverts,"smart manholesthe daily production of garbage is a major problem for large brazilian cities. although the collection system has undergone considerable improvements in recent years, such as selective collection, for example, it is often inefficient. the result of this is the frequent accumulation of non-degradable waste in inappropriate places, such as manholes and wolf mouths. clogging the flow routes reduces the flow of rainwater, causing flooding. when they do not stop at the service stations (culverts), which are part of the city's sewage network, this garbage is destined to streams and rivers, polluting them and facilitating the overflow of their waters in times of flooding. although part of this pollution is due to irregular sewage routes and not all sewage treatment, street waste is also largely responsible for the degradation of streams and rivers. polluted rivers and floods cause disturbances to the population and traffic, compromising real estate and even loss of life. recife has about 1500 km of network of galleries and channels that make up the drainage system of the municipality. because it is a city that is practically at sea level, and because it already experiences some effects from climate change, recife suffers from the incidence of flooding in specific posts. when it rains, the situation tends to get worse in these places. an action of cleaning galleries and channels recently carried out by the city hall in a single street of a neighborhood of the city showed that in just one day of operation, 45 tons of waste were removed. thus, it is desirable to apply measures that prevent this waste from reaching the city's drainage network. known as ""smart culverts"", the technology offers an efficient solution for solving this problem. it is a filter that is placed in the culverts of the city, presenting itself as physical barriers and preventing the waste from seeping. coupled to this mechanism, sensors are installed that indicate the volume of garbage retained in the filter. this information is accompanied by the city's urban cleaning company through an application/software, which sends a responsible team to empty the filter. this technology ensures faster cleaning of the culverts, as workers are able to complete the service in 5 to 10 minutes, while the traditional cleaning method lasts from 40 to 50 minutes. this fact entails more culverts being cleaned in a shorter space of time in the city, leading to a reduction in public spending. in addition, due to the nature of the waste that ends up in the channels and culverts being plastic objects, these materials can be sent for their due recycling. allied to these actions, the city hall should carry out awareness and environmental education activities for the population in order to reduce, mainly, the habit of throwing garbage on the streets. for this project, we aim to apply this technology in a neighborhood of the city of recife,
