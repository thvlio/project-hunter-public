water management,"eco recife program - management and sustainable use of water in the city hall building. filtering gardens: the problem of sanitation and protection of rivers is complex in nature and throughout history the city has still not been able to address them to the extent necessary to reverse the degradation scenario. therefore, it is essential to join forces and use innovative action strategies. from this perspective, some water cleaning and treatment technologies were researched and debated as complementary alternatives to basic sanitation. among the researched alternatives, the technology called filtering gardens was identified as appropriate for this context. this technology presents some characteristics considered important for its application in the city. among them, the relatively simple and low-cost management of the systems; the possibility of water treatment systems being inserted as water gardens with landscape qualities; the use and protection of riverside areas as public areas for environmental recovery, avoiding future occupations and environmental risks; and the emission level of greenhouse gases (ghg) significantly lower than other conventional sewage treatment systems. in the context of the reef, what is proposed is to use filtering garden systems in some stretches of polluted streams, but which still have great potential to recover their environmental qualities, and to become leisure areas for the population. the stretches were selected based on the characteristics of the existing streams and their surroundings (type of urban occupation, topography, water flow, etc.), as well as the observed potential to assume role as exemplary interventions for a new standard of urban action in urban streams from the reef. that is, to establish a paradigm shift in the city. in objective terms, the main guideline to be considered here is the break with the still dominant concept that promoted the rectification and waterproofing of a good part of the reef&#39;s creeks as the main way of protecting urbanized areas from floods. in this way, the four areas selected for the installation of filtering gardens comprise the region of the capibaribe park and the jiquiá park, offering improvement of the waters in the capibaribe river, and the jiquiá and tejipió rivers"
waste management,"ecobarriers. ecobarreiras the habit of the population of the reef to throw their garbage in the waters of the rivers that cross the city dates back to the period of dutch urbanization, when the population was encouraged to dump their waste on the bank of the capibaribe river to make landfills. this habit is currently a chronic problem. when this residue reaches the drainage system, it can cause obstruction of channels and an increase in the frequency of floods, as well as the alteration of the quality of water bodies due to the long time for its decomposition, as is the case of plastics, and also the passage of aquatic animals. when they follow the course of the river, they end up being discharged into the sea, causing silting up; preventing the development of mangroves; harming fauna, such as when they are accidentally ingested or when a bag is attached to an animal&#39;s neck and causes its hanging; contaminating estuary waters; favoring the propagation of disease-transmitting vectors and making nautical sports and tourism activities difficult. in addition to the high cost, it is a temporary solution and difficult to be effective. therefore, proper management must start with preventing waste generation, which is the responsibility of all citizens and the public authorities. no policy can be truly effective without the adherence and participation of the population.parallel to the performance of municipal solid waste actions, the installation of eco-barriers is estimated. ecobarriers are physical obstacles made of floating material, installed close to the mouths of rivers and streams, and which represent an alternative way of cleaning up the course of water in rivers and canals by containing solid waste from anthropic action in the environment. despite recognizing that the implementation of this equipment cannot be seen as an end goal as it is a palliative way of dealing with the issue of waste that ends up in bodies of water, it is possible to find cases of success of its application in other cities do brasil.in addition to their palliative effect in the collection of floating waste, eco-barriers play a significant role in environmental education. it is an itinerant environmental education action to give visibility to the problems of solid waste in rivers, allowing awareness campaigns in the city. the methodology envisaged for its application provides for the formulation and implementation of effective alternatives for the recovery and structuring of the region&#39;s ecosystems in an integrated and participatory manner with the environment and local communities, also relying on educational actions. in this way, it will seek to provide a harmonious and balanced environment so that society can enjoy it responsibly, as well as improving the quality of life and sustainable development of the communities and populations involved. a portion of the floating garbage present in the city&#39;s rivers, both through its direct collection and through the reduction of the amount of garbage emitted by the population. furthermore, the purpose of the project is to significantly retain the input of solid waste in the piped rivers arruda and jordão, in the neighborhoods of bebeibe and boa viagem, in addition to the rainwater channels that flow into the apipucos dam. environments, it is expected to promote conditions for the harmonious development of aquatic organisms, generating ecologically balanced environments"
waste management,"smart manholes. intelligent manholesthe daily production of waste is a major problem for large brazilian cities. although the collection system has undergone considerable improvements in recent years, such as selective collection for example, it often proves to be inefficient. the result of this is the frequent accumulation of non-degradable waste in inappropriate places, such as manholes and storm drains. the clogging of drainage routes reduces the flow of rainwater, causing flooding. when they do not stop at the visit points (culverts), which are part of the city&#39;s sewage network, this garbage is destined for streams and rivers, polluting them and facilitating the overflow of their waters in times of floods. although part of this pollution is due to irregular sewage routes and the lack of sewage treatment, street garbage is also largely responsible for the degradation of streams and rivers. polluted rivers and floods cause inconvenience to the population and traffic, compromising properties and even loss of life. the reef has around 1500 km of galleries and channels that make up the municipality&#39;s drainage system. as it is a city that is practically at sea level, and because it is already experiencing some effects from climate change, the reef suffers from the incidence of flooding in specific posts. when it rains, the situation tends to worsen in these places. an action to clean galleries and gutters recently carried out by the city hall in a single street in a neighborhood of the city showed that in just one day of operation, 45 tons of waste were removed. therefore, it is desirable to apply measures to prevent this waste from reaching the city&#39;s drainage network. known as &quot;intelligent manholes&quot;, the technology offers an efficient solution to solve this problem. it is a filter that is placed in the city&#39;s manholes, presenting itself as physical barriers and preventing the waste from flowing out. coupled to this mechanism, sensors are installed that indicate the volume of garbage retained in the filter. this information is monitored by the city&#39;s urban cleaning company through an application/software, which sends a team responsible for emptying the filter. workers can complete the service in 5 to 10 minutes, while the traditional cleaning method takes 40 to 50 minutes. this fact leads to more manholes being cleaned in a shorter period of time in the city, leading to a reduction in public spending. in addition, due to the nature of the waste that ends up in gutters and manholes being plastic objects, these materials can be sent for recycling. in order to reduce, mainly, the habit of throwing garbage in the streets. for this project, the aim is to apply this technology in a neighborhood of the city of recife, totaling 213 culverts"

transport,"electric routes costa rica. the rutas eléctricas costa rica project seeks to create a network of charging points for electric vehicles in businesses in different communities throughout the national territory. an electric route is defined as a support network for people who want to visit a destination in an electric car can have enough charging points not only on the way, but also when arriving in the community. charging points are located at restaurants, hotels, attractions and other businesses where drivers want to spend time. users will be able to charge their vehicles while they rest, eat, do shopping and errands and/or enjoy the tourist attractions in the area. information on the 32 tourism development centers predefined by the costa rican institute will be used to select these destinations or communities. of tourism (ict) (annex 1), the recommendations of national users to map communities whose location is strategic and the degree of commitment of community leaders. the costa rican electric routes would offer companies, communities and the country in general, a element of differentiation to stand out in the national and ecotourism market and accelerate the adoption of electric mobility"
waste management,"enable more efficient linkages between actors from the three main gir sectors: a profile of alternatives and a piloting of the rural transfer center, an element of the monteverde environmental technology park. in costa rica, up to 50% of solid waste can be organic, while 30% is recoverable materials and 20% ordinary. it is estimated that &lt;5% of the recycling generated at the national level is redirected to recovery processes, while &lt;20 municipalities have composting initiatives. in monteverde, although the ordinary ones only represent 30% of the total generation, their collection and final treatment consumes almost 80% of the municipal budget for the girs. despite investments in infrastructure, equipment, vehicles and personnel, the current municipal recycling program only captures a third of the materials generated each year. among the internal factors that limit the growth of more municipal circular economy initiatives are: 1)inefficiencies in the collection and treatment of ordinary waste that does not leave resources in the annual budget to invest in other areas of action; 2) the overlapping of goals, efforts and investments by public and private actors in the sector instead of the complementary division of roles; 3) capital limitations for works and budget to operate systems on a smaller scale and 4) the choice of technologies or traditional practices with an unfavorable cost-benefit ratio. external factors to consider include the continued decline in international prices for recycling and the growing market for organic agricultural inputs. we anticipate that monteverde, as well as other medium-sized municipalities or other rural/tourist communities, can benefit from a center of “rural” transfer with minimal infrastructure, which does not seek to process the recoverable material in order to process and market it directly, but rather to partially consolidate it and redirect it towards other participants in the value chain. examples of other actors include regional collection centers and local composting initiatives. also, it must incorporate an element for the consolidation of traditional garbage in order to minimize the number of trips per week to a distant sanitary landfill. in this way, the local government could invest its limited resources in constant collections - instead of punctual campaigns - and achieve its two main goals: 1) at the social level, provide an adequate comprehensive service to its entire population; and 2) at an environmental level, reduce the amount of material transported and delivered to the landfill. in parallel, private sector allies can direct their capital towards the transformation of waste and the insertion of products in the market. currently, monteverde has a pilot plan for a productive treatment plant to transform approximately 120 tons/year of organic waste, and a collection center with 2 employees, 1 truck and several specialized teams for recycling consolidation. the future monteverde environmental technology park seeks to integrate the rural transfer center, a wastewater treatment plant, and the productive treatment plant. the following actions are pending to advance the rural transfer center over the next two years. 1. outline and compare the different alternatives available to improve, expand or include collection and treatment services for the three main categories of solid waste (organic, recycling and non-recoverable) in order to optimize the combination of strategies to be developed during a term of 15 years. (6 months)2.implement a pilot of the chosen strategies, using rented equipment or services, short-term cooperative agreements, and limited engagements with the public in order to test and evaluate the proposed strategies, as well as to generate important inputs for the final design of the system and complementary infrastructure.

waste management,"integration of anaerobic co-digestion and passive secondary treatment with an existing centralized composting system in order to take advantage of the energy, water and nutritional value of various organic waste: construction, testing and evaluation of a prototype reactor in the treatment plant productive of monteverde, costa rica. an anaerobic co-digestion (acd) reactor integrated with a centralized composting system presents an opportunity for solid waste and wastewater managers to share costs for sanitation infrastructure and services by treating various organic wastes through a single plant. also, the homogenization and transformation of waste through anaerobic and aerobic decomposition, allows the use of its gaseous, liquid and solid phase in a way that is not achieved only with composting or that is not viable for medium-sized water treatment plants. residuals. in monteverde, 98% of local buildings have septic systems; according to the ministry of environment and energy, 66% of the sludge nationwide does not receive proper treatment, being dumped illegally. 40% of monteverde&#39;s municipal solid waste is organic, while at the national level the average is approximately 55%. less than 20 municipalities in costa rica have centralized composting programs. local agro-industries, such as coffee and dairy farming, also face high costs to manage their respective organic waste. since january 2019, the asada of the monteverde district, as a community water manager, has had the pilot &quot;productive treatment plant&quot; (ptp). the ptp is part of the monteverde environmental technology park, a collaboration with the municipal district council that seeks to expand sanitation services at the local level and increase the resilience of the agricultural sector in the face of climate change. the macroproject incorporates two additional elements: a solid waste transfer center (medium term) and a wastewater treatment plant (long term). during 2020, the german cooperation agency (giz) and the costa rica united states foundation for cooperation (crusa) financed a new actively aerated composting reactor in the provisional ptp, a passive heat exchanger (installed in the reactor), as well as a preliminary study on the substrates generated in the area that could be mixed to optimize biogas production. the latter includes a mapping of the material and laboratory tests of &quot;biomethane potential&quot; for different mixtures. in this third phase of the pilot, we seek to build and evaluate a prototype of the integrated system, testing various mixtures, in order to i) test the efficacy of the sub-elements and the total system, ii) quantify the quality and quantity of the products generated in the gaseous, solid and liquid phase, and iii) identify the possible effects of inhibitors, pathogens or other types of dangerous toxins in the reactions chemicals or in the use of the products afterwards. the specific objectives are the following: 1. build a prototype including a &quot;batch stir tank reactor&quot; (10,000 l) for the cda, a media filter (passive and aerobic) for the recovery of the liquid digestate, and a system for collecting energy in the form of heat, generated in the existing composting chambers and by the new biogas, in order to achieve thermophilic reactions in the cda.2 reactor. evaluate the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the liquid and solid digestate that would allow the compliance with both legal requirements (regs. 33601, 39316) and the obligations of an agricultural clientele. 3. combine the results of the mapping in phase ii and the findings of phase iii to make an optimal operation model in terms of scale, substrates and style/logistics of the reactor. due to the lack of nearby infrastructure to treat organic sludge, and the need to energize the organic-grim sector, we anticipate that the ptp model will be á attractive for other communities with the need to attend to several streams of organic waste but that do not have the capacity to develop independent systems"

waste management,"enable more efficient linkages between actors from the three main gir sectors: a profile of alternatives and a piloting of the rural transfer center, an element of the monteverde environmental technology park. in costa rica, up to 50% of solid waste can be organic, while 30% contains recycling and 20% non-recoverable material. it is estimated that &lt;5% of the recycling generated at the national level is redirected to recovery processes, while &lt;20 municipalities have composting initiatives. in monteverde, although traditional garbage only represents 30% of total generation, its collection and final treatment consumes almost 80% of the municipal budget for girs. despite investments in infrastructure, equipment, vehicles, and personnel, the current municipal recycling program only captures a third of the materials generated each year. internal factors limiting the growth of more municipal circular economy initiatives include: 1) gross inefficiencies in the collection and treatment of traditional garbage that does not leave resources in the annual budget to invest in other areas of action; 2) the overlapping of goals, efforts and investments by public and private actors in the sector instead of the complementary division of roles; 3) capital limitations for works and budget to operate systems on a smaller scale and 4) the choice of technologies or traditional practices with an unfavorable cost-benefit ratio. other external factors to consider include the continued decline in international prices for recycling, and the growing market for organic agricultural inputs. we anticipate that monteverde, as well as other medium-sized municipalities or other rural/tourist communities, can benefit from a “rural” transfer with minimal infrastructure, which does not seek to process the recoverable material in order to process and market it directly, but to partially consolidate it and redirect it to other participants in the value chain. examples of other actors include regional collection centers and local composting initiatives. also, it must incorporate an element for the consolidation of traditional garbage in order to minimize the number of trips per week to a distant sanitary landfill. in this way, the local government could invest its limited resources in constant collections - instead of punctual campaigns - and achieve its two main goals: 1) at the social level, provide an adequate comprehensive service to its entire population; and 2) at an environmental level, reduce the amount of material transported and delivered to the landfill. in parallel, private sector allies can direct their capital towards the transformation of waste and the insertion of products in the market. currently, monteverde has a pilot plant for productive treatment to transform approximately 120 tons/year of waste organic products, and a collection center with 2 employees, 1 truck, and various specialized equipment for recycling consolidation. the future monteverde environmental technology park seeks to integrate the rural transfer center, a wastewater treatment plant, and the productive treatment plant. the following actions are pending to advance the rural transfer center over the next two years. 1. outline and compare the different alternatives available to improve, expand or include the collection and treatment services of the three main categories of solid waste (organic, recycling and non-recoverable) in order to optimize the combination of strategies to be developed during a term of 15 years. (6 months)2. implement a pilot of the chosen strategies, using leased equipment or services, short-term cooperative agreements, and limited engagements with the public in order to test and evaluate the proposed strategies, as well as to generate important inputs for the final design of the system and complementary infrastructure. (18 months) total investment cost to be defined"
waste management,"integration of anaerobic co-digestion and passive secondary treatment with an existing centralized composting system in order to take advantage of the energy, water and nutritional value of various organic waste: construction, testing and evaluation of a prototype reactor in the treatment plant productive of monteverde, costa rica. an anaerobic co-digestion (acd) reactor integrated with a centralized composting system presents an opportunity for solid waste and wastewater managers to share costs for sanitation infrastructure and services by treating various organic wastes through a single plant. also, the homogenization and transformation of waste through anaerobic and aerobic decomposition, allows the use of its gaseous, liquid and solid phase in a way that is not achieved only with composting, or that is not viable for medium-sized waste treatment plants. sewage water. in monteverde, 98% of local buildings have septic systems; according to the ministry of environment and energy, 66% of the sludge nationwide does not receive proper treatment, being dumped illegally. 40% of monteverde&#39;s municipal solid waste is organic, while at the national level the average is approximately 55%. less than 20 municipalities in costa rica have centralized composting programs. local agro-industries, such as coffee and dairy farming, also face high costs to manage their respective organic waste. since january 2019, the asada of the monteverde district, as a community water manager, has had the pilot &quot;productive treatment plant&quot; (ptp). the ptp is part of the monteverde environmental technology park, a collaboration with the municipal district council that seeks to expand sanitation services at the local level and increase the resilience of the agricultural sector in the face of climate change. the macroproject incorporates two additional elements: a solid waste transfer center (medium term) and a wastewater treatment plant (long term). during 2020, the german cooperation agency (giz) and the costa rica united states foundation for cooperation (crusa) financed a new actively aerated composting reactor in the provisional ptp, a passive heat exchanger (installed in the reactor), as well as a preliminary study on the substrates generated in the area that could be mixed to optimize biogas production. the latter includes a mapping of the material and laboratory tests of &quot;biomethane potential&quot; for different mixtures. in this third phase of the pilot, we seek to build and evaluate a prototype of the integrated system, testing various mixtures, in order to i) test the efficacy of the sub-elements and the total system, ii) quantify the quality and quantity of the products generated in the gaseous, solid and liquid phase, and iii) identify the possible effects of inhibitors, pathogens or other types of dangerous toxins in the reactions chemicals or in the use of the products afterwards. the specific objectives are the following: 1. build a prototype including a &quot;batch stir tank reactor&quot; (10,000 l) for the cda, a media filter (passive and aerobic) for the recovery of the liquid digestate, and a system for collecting energy in the form of heat, generated in the existing composting chambers and by the new biogas, in order to achieve thermophilic reactions in the cda.2 reactor. evaluate the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the liquid and solid digestate that would allow compliance with both legal requirements (regs. 33601, 39316) and with the obligations of an agricultural clientele.3. combine the results of the phase ii mapping and the phase iii findings to make an optimal operating model in terms of scale, substrates, and reactor style/logistics. due to the lack of nearby infrastructure to treat organic sludge, and the need in order to energize the organic-waste sector, we anticipate that the ptp model will be attractive to other communities that need to address various organic waste streams but do not have the capacity to develop independent systems."

energy efficiency / retrofit,"energy efficiency in public buildings of the amg public administration. problem/justification according to the inventory of greenhouse gases of the metropolitan area of guadalajara, the stationary energy sector is the cause of 38% of the total emissions generated in the amg, product of the electrical energy consumed in domestic buildings, government and commercial buildings. for this reason, it is important to initiate a transition to clean energy that can be used in buildings. likewise, an analysis was carried out of the governing instruments of the amg municipalities in terms of climate change, the municipal climate change programs (pmcc), in order to find synergies in the reduction and mitigation objectives in the energy sector, as well as in the actions that are part of said instrument or outside of it, referring to energy efficiency. it should be noted that 5 of the 9 municipalities already have their program (guadalajara, ixtlahuacán de los quinces, juanacatlán, tlaquepaque and zapopan); 2 more are being prepared (tonalá and tlajomulco); and only 2 do not have this (el salto and zapotlanejo). some of the most relevant actions that could be identified are the following: • change of lighting to led. • efficient air conditioning in public buildings, homes, and commercial establishments. • energy efficiency in residential energy consumption and construction or bioclimatic adaptation in buildings.• zero energy program for buildings and public spaces.• energy efficiency code.• purchase of clean energy.• renewable energy generation (photovoltaic panels).• substitution from the government vehicle fleet to electric cars.• solar heaters.therefore, despite the fact that the municipalities are currently developing specific actions in terms of energy generation and efficiency, there is no technical study (diagnosis) for the establishment of a baseline and analysis of the feasibility of intervention. the implementation of a diagnosis in buildings public is of high importance; constituting as a priority element for all the municipalities that are part of the amg, implement generation and energy efficiency actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions based on a technical diagnosis, in which they are expressed: co2e reduction goals ; visualization of costs; and a prioritization of the actions to be carried out according to their feasibility. objective: prepare an analysis and diagnosis of the energy demand of the amg government buildings, in their facilities and equipment. based on this, propose solutions to achieve a reduction, both in energy consumption and in economic spending, derived from an improvement in energy management and efficiency, as well as the application of more efficient technologies without reducing energy comfort. some areas of opportunity • due to the great capacity of the metropolitan area, in terms of electricity generation through solar energy, the possibility of incorporating clean energy generation through photovoltaic panels is proposed, which will result in greater energy autonomy, as well as a decrease in expenditures for the payment of cfe bills. the proposal on the remainder of this operation, the savings, is based on the formation of a metropolitan fund that can designate that resource for the replication of the same project or other climate change projects. • establish the feasibility of replacing combustion vehicles with hybrid and electric vehicles to reduce ghg, adding to the energy transition. • socialize the issue with the state energy agency of the state"
waste management,"“integral management of urban solid waste in the amg”. this project has the following points as its objective: • reducing the amount of urban solid waste, which is sent to a sanitary landfill, as a result of promoting a better segregation of the waste and its delivery to collection centers that will serve as intermediaries with parties stakeholders. • update municipal programs for the comprehensive management of urban solid waste and establish networks that allow for inter-municipal collaboration • familiarize the population with the issue of &quot;waste prevention&quot; so that it is a practice adaptable to daily life and the population is capable of making decisions in a conscious manner. proposals the following describes the activities, by management stage, that are sought to be included and implemented within the amg municipalities to update their programs or municipal plans for comprehensive waste management. urban solids. prevention and generation, segregation at home, primary separation, secondary separation, inorganic waste that is difficult to recycle, delivery and collection of waste, collection center establishments, clean points, recovery of equipment for second use, waste collection expected results achieve a reduction in waste that are sent to the landfill an environmental education program is started to educate and raise awareness among the general population for a continuous improvement in the results reach agreements with private companies to have a great coverage in the amg improve the image of the amg by correct segregation and location of collection points and collection centers reduce emissions from waste transfer likewise, it is important to encourage new technologies that make it possible to treat waste that up to now is difficult to recycle and are sent to landfills consider the issue of charging for collection services, always that it is beef waste that is difficult to recycle or waste that has not been correctly segregated"
water management,"filter gardens. filtering gardens: the problem of sanitation and protection of rivers is complex in nature and throughout history the city has still not been able to address them to the extent necessary to reverse the degradation scenario. therefore, it is essential to join forces and use innovative action strategies. from this perspective, some water cleaning and treatment technologies were researched and debated as complementary alternatives to basic sanitation. among the researched alternatives, the technology called filtering gardens was identified as appropriate for this context. this technology presents some characteristics considered important for its application in the city. among them, the relatively simple and low-cost management of the systems; the possibility of water treatment systems being inserted as water gardens with landscape qualities; the use and protection of riverside areas as public areas for environmental recovery, avoiding future occupations and environmental risks; and the emission level of greenhouse gases (ghg) significantly lower than other conventional sewage treatment systems. in the context of the reef, what is proposed is to use filtering garden systems in some stretches of polluted streams, but which still have great potential to recover their environmental qualities, and to become leisure areas for the population. the stretches were selected based on the characteristics of the existing streams and their surroundings (type of urban occupation, topography, water flow, etc.), as well as the observed potential to assume role as exemplary interventions for a new standard of urban action in urban streams from the reef. that is, to establish a paradigm shift in the city. in objective terms, the main guideline to be considered here is the break with the still dominant concept that promoted the rectification and waterproofing of a good part of the reef&#39;s creeks as the main way of protecting urbanized areas from floods. in this way, the four areas selected for the installation of filtering gardens comprise the region of the capibaribe park and the jiquiá park, offering improvement of the waters in the capibaribe river, and the jiquiá and tejipió rivers"
energy efficiency / retrofit,"solar energy in municipal buildings. solar energy in municipal buildings in view of the actions foreseen in the reef&#39;s ghg emissions reduction plan, the solar energy project for equipment in the city hall of recife aims to install photovoltaic panels, generating 28.251 mwh annually to supply municipal public institutions and reduce gee impacts at 7,789.18 tco2e. with the installation of these panels, the city hall will produce energy for public institutions, but will also promote environmental education from the visibility of solar panels throughout the city, giving the population an example of a sustainable way to generate their energy. in this scope, it is also necessary to articulate with other public and private spheres for the establishment of goals and incentives to encourage the use of clean energy by the population. in modules, prioritizing action in the pcr headquarters building, in municipal schools and daycare centers, in the city&#39;s gyms and, finally, in upinhas and family health units. if implemented, this project will generate annual savings of r$17,424. 000.00 to municipal coffers from the sixth year of application. in this way, by 2037, when the reef turns 500 years old, the municipality will have stopped spending r$268,360,000.00 on energy bills"
waste management,"ecobarriers. ecobarreiras the habit of the population of the reef to throw their garbage in the waters of the rivers that cross the city dates back to the period of dutch urbanization, when the population was encouraged to dump their waste on the bank of the capibaribe river to make landfills. this habit is currently a chronic problem. when this residue reaches the drainage system, it can cause obstruction of channels and an increase in the frequency of floods, as well as the alteration of the quality of water bodies due to the long time for its decomposition, as is the case of plastics, and also the passage of aquatic animals. when they follow the course of the river, they end up being discharged into the sea, causing silting up; preventing the development of mangroves; harming fauna, such as when they are accidentally ingested or when a bag gets stuck around an animal&#39;s neck and causes its hanging; contaminating estuary waters; favoring the propagation of disease-transmitting vectors and making nautical sports and tourism activities difficult. in addition to the high cost, it is a temporary solution and difficult to be effective. therefore, proper management must start with preventing waste generation, which is the responsibility of all citizens and the public authorities. no policy can be truly effective without the adherence and participation of the population.parallel to the performance of municipal solid waste actions, the installation of eco-barriers is estimated. ecobarriers are physical obstacles made of floating material, installed close to the mouths of rivers and streams, and which represent an alternative way of cleaning up the course of water in rivers and canals by containing solid waste from anthropic action in the environment. despite recognizing that the implementation of this equipment cannot be seen as an end goal as it is a palliative way of dealing with the issue of waste that ends up in bodies of water, it is possible to find cases of success of its application in other cities do brasil.in addition to their palliative effect in the collection of floating waste, eco-barriers play a significant role in environmental education. it is an itinerant environmental education action to give visibility to the problems of solid waste in rivers, allowing awareness campaigns in the city. the methodology envisaged for its application provides for the formulation and implementation of effective alternatives for the recovery and structuring of the region&#39;s ecosystems in an integrated and participatory manner with the environment and local communities, also relying on educational actions. in this way, it will seek to provide a harmonious and balanced environment so that society can enjoy it responsibly, as well as improving the quality of life and sustainable development of the communities and populations involved. a portion of the floating garbage present in the city&#39;s rivers, both through its direct collection and through the reduction of the amount of garbage emitted by the population. furthermore, the purpose of the project is to significantly retain the input of solid waste in the piped rivers arruda and jordão, in the neighborhoods of bebeibe and boa viagem, in addition to the rainwater channels that flow into the apipucos dam. environments, it is expected to promote conditions for the harmonious development of aquatic organisms, generating ecologically balanced environments"
waste management,"smart manholes. intelligent manholesthe daily production of waste is a major problem for large brazilian cities. although the collection system has undergone considerable improvements in recent years, such as selective collection for example, it often proves to be inefficient. the result of this is the frequent accumulation of non-degradable waste in inappropriate places, such as manholes and storm drains. the clogging of drainage routes reduces the flow of rainwater, causing flooding. when they do not stop at the visit points (culverts), which are part of the city&#39;s sewage network, this garbage is destined for streams and rivers, polluting them and facilitating the overflow of their waters in times of floods. although part of this pollution is due to irregular sewage routes and the lack of sewage treatment, street garbage is also largely responsible for the degradation of streams and rivers. polluted rivers and floods cause inconvenience to the population and traffic, compromising properties and even loss of life. the reef has around 1500 km of galleries and channels that make up the municipality&#39;s drainage system. as it is a city that is practically at sea level, and because it is already experiencing some effects from climate change, the reef suffers from the incidence of flooding in specific posts. when it rains, the situation tends to worsen in these places. an action to clean galleries and gutters recently carried out by the city hall in a single street in a neighborhood of the city showed that in just one day of operation, 45 tons of waste were removed. therefore, it is desirable to apply measures to prevent this waste from reaching the city&#39;s drainage network. known as &quot;intelligent manholes&quot;, the technology offers an efficient solution to solve this problem. it is a filter that is placed in the city&#39;s manholes, presenting itself as physical barriers and preventing the waste from flowing out. coupled to this mechanism, sensors are installed that indicate the volume of garbage retained in the filter. this information is monitored by the city&#39;s urban cleaning company through an application/software, which sends a team responsible for emptying the filter. workers can complete the service in 5 to 10 minutes, while the traditional cleaning method takes 40 to 50 minutes. this fact leads to more manholes being cleaned in a shorter period of time in the city, leading to a reduction in public spending. in addition, due to the nature of the waste that ends up in gutters and manholes being plastic objects, these materials can be sent for recycling. in order to reduce, mainly, the habit of throwing garbage in the streets. for this project, the aim is to apply this technology in a neighborhood of the city of recife, totaling 213 culverts"
transport,"cycle lanes for the weather. cycle lanes for the climate the main objective of the project is to improve the city of recife with an efficient cycle path system, which meets the cycling master plan for the metropolitan region of recife and the ghg reduction plan for the reef (low carbon plan), with actions that provide for the implementation of tree-lined bicycle lanes. for this reason, priority will be given to the city&#39;s structuring cycle paths, ensuring their afforestation and, in this way, reducing the city&#39;s heat islands and ghg emissions. cycle path and 100% of the low carbon plan target, ensuring that 22,220 tco2e are no longer emitted due to the implemented cycle paths and 550 tco2e due to afforestation, totaling 22,770 tco2e of mitigation annually"
