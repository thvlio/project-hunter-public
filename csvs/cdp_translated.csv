At present, there are multiple vehicular technologies available in circulation that have caused conventional gas measurement methods to become obsolete because emissions are lower, inclusive, than the detection limits of current equipment and measurement methods, corresponding to constant no-load and idle speed measurements for gasoline-powered vehicles and free acceleration tests for opacity measurement. This is the case of diesel vehicles with particulate matter emission control systems such as diesel particulate filters or selective catalytic reduction systems for nitrogen oxides, and in indirect injection gasoline vehicles conventional three-way catalysts and for those With direct injection systems, some have gasoline particle filters. that under the current methods it is not possible to identify the environmental state of the vehicle and it does not allow to establish the emissions under normal operating conditions, on the other hand, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development is updating the norm that establishes the new emission limits to migrate to euro 6 and vi in light and heavy diesel vehicles respectively, as well as a rise to euro 4 in gasoline vehicles and currently euro 3 in motorcycles. For the above, it is intended to carry out an update of the measurement methods in order to establish the compliance status and updating of the emission limits for the multiple technologies available in the city. For this purpose, it is contemplated to carry out: - Implementation of control by counting the number of particles in diesel vehicles. - Formulation of monitoring and environmental characterization by means of dynamic tests on vehicles in use and inclusion of nox control.- support in the formulation of the obd control program directed by the ministry of environment"

181,"waste to energy pilot project. waste to energy (wte) plant for knysna general process descriptionthis process turns general waste material, such as household waste and waste that ends up in landfills, into electricity, fuel and heat. one of the main problems that one faces with these types of waste is the fact that those wastes vary in composition, content and size. most technologies available on the market today can handle only a specific type of waste, such as biomass or plastics etc. this process has been designed to keep such limitations to a minimum and the design and choice of the technology parts presents unique advantages:•robustness – the process can handle large variations in content, size and composition of the feedstock•simplicity – the design of the process has been done such, that operating and maintaining the process can been done by community members using local suppliers for spare parts•variability – the process produces electricity, fuel and heat. the design also allows for the adjustability of the electricity and fuel ratio. depending on the requirements of the clients at a particular site, the operating parameters can be set to optimize either fuel or electricity or bothshort technology descriptionthis technology uses air gasification to turn the waste material at a temperature of 1000k into synthesis gas. after cleaning, the synthesis gas will be sent to a fischer-tropsch synthesis (fts) reactor where it is turned into products. the liquid hydrocarbons will be separated out using cooling water which can become hot water for the community. the unreacted gases plus the gaseous products will be burned in a generator to produce electricity. because of the simplicity of the flow through the plant, the relative amount of fuel and electricity production can be adjusted to meet different demands. it has been shown, that the production of two products from the same system is more efficient than a one product plant and at the same time supplies the community with its energy needs. furthermore the liquid fuel also becomes an efficient energy storage mechanism when less electricity is needed and this is economically efficient. specifications for the knysna wte plantfeed:•carbon containing material such as biomass, polyethylene, polypropylene etc.  omaterials such as glass and computer parts cannot be turned into products and serve as an inert in the process.  in other words although they can be processed, they impact the efficiency of the plant.omaterials containing pvc and polyurethane contain chloride and cyanide groups respectively and would require specific clean-up technologies.  similarly tyres are very high in sulphur and would require an adaption of the gas clean up technology if used as a feed.•feed rate: two options: 300 kg/day or 1000 kg/dayproduct  (fuel and electricity are optimized in this scenario): •electricity: up to 15 kw at 220 v 50 kw at 220 v. synthetic crude oil:  15 liter per day 50 liter per day of primarily linear paraffins, average number of carbon atoms c8-c16. •heat: up to 10 kw 33 kw of heat at 200˚c. this could be used for example for space heating, drying or water heating. it could heat up to 1000 l/hour 3300 l/hour of water from 25˚c to 60˚c. for an average consumption of 150 l/day for a family of four, this would supply 160 families 520 families with hot water. possible small business development opportunitiesdepending on the amount of waste at a specific site, temporary (one could look at months or years of operation) small business development opportunities could arise during the operation of the plant. •members of local communities can be trained to operate and maintain the plant•secondary businesses can be set up to supply spare parts for the plant •members of local communities can be employed to collect waste•the produced electricity and heat can be used to supply small businesses that are or can be set up in close proximity of the container, for example:"

288,"city of toronto renewable natural gas (rng) initiative. solid waste management services (swms) is seeking to extend the lifespan of it's resources, become more sustainable and look for initiatives that will contribute towards the city of toronto's tranformto goals and targets of greenhouse gas reduction and greater usage of renewable energy. at present, swms is very close to successfully commissioning it's first renewable natural gas (rng) facility at the dufferin road organics processing facility (dopf) and developing it's second facility at the disco road organics processing facility (dropf). swms currently flares the methane produced at both sites and therefore wants to tap into this underutilized resource. the act of flaring can be completely eliminated from our current operations, which avoids greenhouse gas emissions and a renewable gas can be produced that the city can use internally either by heating its buildings or fuelling its heavy duty collection trucks, therefore reducing costs and contributing to a circular economy. swms has plans to expand its rng initiative to any new organics processing facilities constructed in the future, it's landfills and any other sites where feasible. the expectation is that swms will have the capacity to not only collect and process all organic waste (a portion is currently collected and processed by a third-party) and convert all of it's organic waste collected to rng. left over capacity will allow swms to explore collaboration or partnerships with other municipalities or local organizations. swms division produces biogas from processing organics collected through the green bin program in the city-owned organics processing facilities. one of the main components of the biogas produced is methane, which can be refined into a renewable natural gas (rng), a carbon-neutral, if not carbon-negative fuel. rng projects enable swms to adopt a closed-loop approach that allows for local organics management, whereby organics collection trucks can ultimately be powered by the waste product they collect. since 2015, swms has been working closely with enbridge gas inc. (egi) and other stakeholders to develop its rng infrastructure. dufferin organics processing facility, currently in commissioning, will be the city's first rng facility and will produce 3.38m m3 of rng annually. the production of rng from biogas has an environmental benefit of ""closing the carbon loop"" by avoiding the current practise of flaring the biogas produced during the anaerobic digestion process, cleaning up the biogas to rng pipeline quality and displacing fossil fuel with green fuel. the project's specific reductions on a lifecycle ghg emissions basis will be 9,356 tonnes co2e per year. the gigajoules of energy produced by the dufferin facility will enable the city to reach 8% of the transformto goal of generating 1.5m gigajoules of energy from biogas by 2030"

This plan proposes the articulation between a set of actions, technically and financially viable, aimed at improving the mobility system of the city, guaranteeing equity, sustainability and improvement in the quality of life of the inhabitants. In this way, it is intended to physically, operationally and fare-integrate the collective public transport system, under the following scheme: [11transit and transport information control system and center: essentially what is sought is a change in the traditional business scheme to one based on new technologies, in such a way that the operation systems allow greater control and better planning of the service. Unified collection system: the money from the collection is deposited in a fiduciary who is in charge of making the payment to the transport operators (trunks and feeders). fl reorganization of collective public transport: optimization of routes, adaptation of infrastructure to the new operating conditions of the collective public transport system and construction of interchange points in the center. Coverage of 67% of the urban area would go from 94%. The master plan contemplates diagnosing the mobility, urban planning, environmental, legal, socioeconomic and financial sectors. At this point, it is important to include as a proposal and within the public transportation system the replacement and scrapping of buses that run on ACPM fuels, or vehicles that run on natural gas. this measure has a potential reduction of 82370 t coe"

Ecobarriers are physical obstacles made of floating material, installed close to the mouths of rivers and streams, and which represent an alternative way of cleaning up the course of water in rivers and canals by containing solid waste from anthropic action in the environment. despite recognizing that the implementation of this equipment cannot be seen as an end goal as it is a palliative way of dealing with the issue of waste that ends up in bodies of water, it is possible to find cases of success of its application in other cities do brasil.in addition to their palliative effect in the collection of floating waste, eco-barriers play a significant role in environmental education. it is an itinerant environmental education action to give visibility to the problems of solid waste in rivers, allowing awareness campaigns in the city. the methodology envisaged for its application provides for the formulation and implementation of effective alternatives for the recovery and structuring of the region&#39;s ecosystems in an integrated and participatory manner with the environment and local communities, also relying on educational actions. in this way, it will seek to provide a harmonious and balanced environment so that society can enjoy it responsibly, as well as improving the quality of life and sustainable development of the communities and populations involved. a portion of the floating garbage present in the city&#39;s rivers, both through its direct collection and through the reduction of the amount of garbage emitted by the population.

This public-private alliance includes a solid waste transfer center, a wastewater treatment plant and a productive treatment plant to transform various organic waste into resources. This initiative builds on existing projects and programs to promote more synergies and economies of scale over time, spread costs across different stages of their development, and strengthen relevant value chains. In addition, it incorporates elements to facilitate joint initiatives between territories of the Central Pacific and Chorotega regions, to enable the management of non-traditional waste, as well as to incubate new innovations in the recovery and transformation of waste. the set of designs, studies and final works can add up to us$13.4 million with a range of socio-environmental benefits including: ●358% increase in the recovery of recoverable solid waste by 2026●1,888 m3/day of treated wastewater by 2030● 50% more refrigerant gases collected for final disposal by 2030●1,667.23 tons co2-e/year reduced●at least 11 communities, 6,500 inhabitants, 300 companies and 50 farmers and 250,000 tourists/year currently benefiting, the municipal council and the barbecue They are in the process of executing a purchase-sale option for the ideal site, previously identified, through a budget item and a commercial credit, respectively, with a total cost of us$700,000. four university groups have contributed to the conceptual design of the site, and the asada has the terms of reference for a comprehensive study of the wastewater treatment system (approximate cost of the study would be US$300,000), which were prepared by the Costa Rican Institute of aqueducts and sewage. It is anticipated that by the end of 2022 the municipal council will have the terms of reference for a preliminary design, cost estimate, and verification of pre-feasibility/impacts on the transfer center and the productive treatment plant. The estimated cost for the design and study is US$40,000, of which a portion will be included in the next extraordinary budget. This proposal seeks to mobilize counterpart funds in order to accelerate the development of the municipal subcomponents. Although partial financing of future works is anticipated through budget items, there is also interest in other mechanisms such as subsidies from government entities or international cooperation, bank loans, and legal vehicles that facilitate private investment. this particular area should make up a significant portion of the pre-feasibility study considering that financing itself may be another innovative aspect, but the scale of each investment stage may limit the feasibility or suitability of certain mechanisms. During the second semester of 2022, both parties will seek to renew, but also expand, the current inter-institutional cooperation agreement in order to include other allies in the mobilization of resources, and development of infrastructure and services.

698,"renewable and resilient electricity system. since 2010, the city has been exploring municipalization -- or creating our own municipal electric utility -- as a way to dramatically reduce the carbon intensity of our electric supply under direct control.  currently, boulder’s electricity generation mix is determined by the third-party investor-owned electric utility and therefore is outside of the city's control. the exploration was put on pause in november 2020 when the boulder community voted for a franchise agreement with xcel energy, with residents and businesses agreeing to remain xcel customers under a new partnership.  while xcel energy has made great strides in their own climate commitments, stating a goal of 85% emissions reduction by 2030 against a 2005 baseline and an 80% renewable grid by 2030 -- this ambition does not align with boulder's commitment to getting to 100% renewable electricity supply by 2030. therefore, the city is seeking options on how to address the remaining emissions gap in 2030 to ensure the city is procuring emissions free electricity by that date. in evaluating potential options, the city will seek to quantify the cost associated with various pathways to factor into decision making. the city is also exploring financing solutions to enhance the resilience of the electrical infrastructure through strategic undergrounding.  currently, 40% of the distribution lines serving the city remain overhead.  the overhead lines are highly concentrated in areas of the community that are of particular concern for climate event impacts (flood, fire, wind). the city is also exploring acquisition of the streetlighting system that serves the community to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the system"

The municipality of Águeda has more than 1,500km of water lines (temporary and permanent). Rivers and streams are a structural element of the natural morphology and landscape of the municipality of Águeda, with different naturalized areas and opportunities for recreation and production, for the population, influencing urban expansion, simultaneously as a pole of urban attractiveness and an area of strong exposure to the risk of floods, when extreme phenomena occur, namely due to the proximity to the Águeda river. In view of this context, projects for the rehabilitation, enhancement and protection of riparian galleries generally aim to contribute to the pursuit of a set of objectives at different levels –environmental, hydraulic and socioeconomic – which converge in river rehabilitation processes and which aim to:⎯ comply with community and national legislation on cleaning and enhancing water lines (dqa and water law)⎯ recover the riverside gallery and consequent functionality of the natural riverside systems, promoting connectivity with the surrounding areas⎯ favoring the enhancement landscape and biodiversity of the water environment, along with a growing connectivity between natural faunal and flowering communities of the riverside corridors⎯ fostering riverside habitats, riverine and swampy starches, creating the necessary conditions for the use of these spaces (and the main bed) by the autochthonous fauna, namely for the target species of this project: newt orange-bellied (lissitriton boscaii), otter (lutra lutra) and laurel cow (lucanus cervus), ash-blue (laeosopis roboris); common verve (cobitis paludica)⎯ environmental enhancement of plots adjacent to waterline sections⎯ rehabilitation of pre-existing pedestrian trails and agricultural paths, bordering waterline sections⎯ encouraging people to get in touch with nature, acting on the premise that interaction with nature has proven results in improving people&#39;s health, both physical and emotional⎯ increasing the attractiveness of river spaces, creating and revitalizing places with deep meaning and interest for local populations and visitors⎯ contribute for the improvement of water lines by promoting social entrepreneurship activities⎯ promoting the safety of people, goods and services operating near water lines⎯ waterfronts thus constitute an opportunity for territorial rehabilitation and environmental, by promoting ecosystems and increasing biodiversity and valuing and promoting the surrounding areas. interventions aim to improve the ecological conservation status of water courses not yet benefited by municipal interventions, in line with what has already been done in other rivers and streams"

713,"energy use in the Los Angeles sanitary landfill. In the municipality of Neiva, per capita waste production in 2014 is estimated to be 0.2260 tons/inhab-year. 100% of the waste generated in the urban area is taken to the Los Angeles landfill. Through this action, a correct system for extracting the biogas generated in the landfill will be implemented. currently a passive extraction is carried out with a subsequent combustion without energy use in a torch. however, better management and energy use of the generated biogas can be achieved. For this, an active collection is proposed through wells and collection ducts, and its transformation into electrical energy through motor-alternator groups. In this way, it will go from a 30% uptake to a 65% uptake. This action reduces emissions through two different mechanisms: 1. reduction associated with the reduction of gel emissions due to the generation of waste in the study area, 2. reduction of emissions associated with the substitution of electricity from the network, by clean electricity generated in the engines. It is estimated that in 2050 5.9 MW could be obtained. A small part of this electricity production would be destined for self-consumption (around 7%), and the rest would be connected to the grid, replacing the electricity from the grid with clean energy generated in the motors."

749,"solar at the butterworth landfill. over 10 years ago, the city of grand rapids began exploring installing solar panels on the butterworth landfill, which is a 190-acre superfund site where cleanup was completed in 2000. due to the protective cap that was installed and cannot be disturbed, ground mounted solar panels, an open field or a paved parking lot are the only viable beneficial reuses of the property.  in 2013, the epa completed a solar reuse assessment and found that the butterworth landfill is well-suited for solar power generation due to the relatively flat, open and unobstructed surface of the site as well as plenty of sun exposure and close proximity to necessary electricity infrastructure. in that assessment, the epa determined that 63 acres were viable for solar installation. the city entered into a contract with a solar developer in 2015 for an approximately 2.5 megawatt dc array in the southwest corner of the landfill that was intended to go over or under the river and supply the city’s water resource recovery facility (wrrf). the developer ultimately went bankrupt and the project fell through. more recent estimates show that an approximately 12.6 megawatt ac solar array that would generate an estimated 20 million kilowatt hours of electricity a year could be constructed across the 63 acres. this much renewable electricity is equivalent to eliminating carbon dioxide emissions associated with 2,575 homes’ electricity use for one year. the city has been working diligently with consumers energy and the city’s energy advisory committee over the last four years to determine if and how the city could generate electricity at the landfill via solar and feed it directly onto the city’s primary circuit, which distributes electricity to the city’s street lighting system and facilities. with the construction of the biodigester at the wrrf, the wrrf’s electricity consumption has significantly decreased and combined with the complexities of getting across the river, the city is not currently pursuing solar generation at butterworth supplying the wrrf. this type of “behind-the-meter” solar installation is by far the most financially feasible. in addition, the city has been exploring whether portions of the site could be developed as a low income community solar garden and in support of other local institutions desires to source locally produced renewable energy. to date, the increased costs associated with developing solar on a remediated superfund site with a cap in place  have been an obstacle. the city also recognizes the potential of pairing solar with battery storage, which would allow the city to supply its nighttime street lights with solar produced electricity during the day that would be stored in a battery. however, the costs of large scale batteries are also cost prohibitive. the city believes it could install a 1.6 megawatt ac solar array in the northwest corner of the landfill and produce approximately 3 million kilowatt hours a year for the primary circuit at a cost of about $6 – 8 million. the addition of battery storage would support a larger array and supply power to the city’s street lighting system at night. at an estimated cost of $380 per kilowatt hour for battery storage, the addition of battery storage for 1 million kilowatt hours would cost at least an additional $380 million. the city estimates that it might be able to support 65 low income households’ additional cost to supply renewables to them for one year with $10 million (premium cost for renewable, households are still responsible for their electricity bill although they receive credits when solar is generated). or 22 homes for 3 years"

765,"On-road control of mobile sources through the implementation of remote sensors. One of the strategies to increase coverage in the control of mobile sources and determine their environmental status under real operating conditions, is through the use of telematic control systems, such as remote sensors, which ostensibly increases the number of vehicles tested and presents typical emissions results from the operation. This technology is similar to lifeguard cameras that detect speeding, but focused on the detection of pollutant emissions in real vehicle operating conditions. In the case of the SDA, in 2019, pilot tests were carried out with remote sensors under real operating conditions. This study and others in the literature show that it is a viable option to increase coverage and vehicle environmental monitoring in the vehicle fleet, however there are challenges to solve for its application in the city, such as:-regulations: there are no emission limits established to carry out the control by this method and that is comparable to a conventional measurement on the road. on the other hand, electronic records for environmental measurements are not regulated.-standardization: there is no standardization framework for this type of metric at the national level.-technological: it is a method that is in the process of development worldwide, for Therefore, there may be technological variations in measurement methods and metrics. -operational: the operational framework for control by remote sensors must be defined, associating an operational staff to guarantee continuity in the measurements, control and analysis of the results. as well as the definition of measurement points, among other parameters.-economic: it is necessary to establish what is most appropriate to carry out the control by remote sensors, from an outsourcing or from the purchase of measurement equipment of the company. city.-integration: there is a challenge of integrating the data obtained and the information and technology systems of the sda and the city. Due to the above, it is necessary to solve each of the unknowns, therefore, a phase is proposed of a second pilot, and in the positive case of a viable evaluation in each of the control components, the implementation phase continues, in order to achieve real control in the city by 2023 using this technology whose potential contemplates a 20-fold increase in the coverage of tested vehicles"

Spontaneous fires sometimes start in several places on the site, especially during the dry season. given the depth of the waste layer, the landfill gas thus generated is perhaps stored in medium quantities in the existing waste, so that very quickly the gas from the waste layer of small depths spreads directly into the atmosphere.the different layout designs for the chefchaouen public landfill include:•design 1: extension and creation of two new zones a and b: extension and creation of two new zones (see figure 8): zone a, which is located to the north of the former zone 1, and zone b which is located to the south of zone 1. in parallel, the operation of the landfill continues in zone 1 during the creation of zones a and b (phase 1); rehabilitation and closure of the old zone 1 at the end of this phase, which is that of the creation of compartments a and b.ophase 1: extension of the operating surface; installation of protective dykes; leachate and stormwater drainage system; ophase 2: rehabilitation and closure of zone 1•design 2: spreading the waste over the entire landfillthe fundamental concept consists of distributing and compressing the waste that has slipped on the sides of zone c (total rehabilitated surface), then to cover with soil.•"

This action is in line with the &quot;discharge management and sanitation plan&quot; of the neiva aqueduct and sewerage company - las ceibas, the service concessionaire, and the neiva 2016-2019 development plan. In this last document, it is planned to have two wastewater treatment plants (PTAR) for the year 2019, one in the Santander Bridge with an approximate coverage of 86% of Neiva&#39;s wastewater where two collectors are connected and the second in the unloading site of the collector el venado in the no magdalena. however, before building the WWTP, efforts should be focused on collecting wastewater, expanding coverage and transporting it through the interconnection of the different collectors that discharge. After making sure that adequate collection is available, treatment coverage will be progressively increased, with the objective that by 2050 100% of the wastewater generated in urban areas will be treated. On the other hand, the discharge of the treated water will be carried out in the Magdalena river, which has a great dilution and self-purification capacity due to its hydraulic conditions and flow.

1288,"efficient public lighting. This project consists of the modernization, replacement, and expansion of the public lighting system of the Metropolitan District of Quito (DMQ), replacing conventional luminaires (around 223,000) with efficient public lighting, promoting energy efficiency, citizen security, reducing the city&#39;s carbon footprint and generate savings for citizens and the municipal government. a full replacement of conventional lighting could mean halving (0.5%) the contribution of public lighting to quito&#39;s carbon footprint. The project promotes energy security by reducing electricity consumption in public lighting (6% of total electricity consumption in the city; twice the regional average), as well as installing LED lamps, which have better efficiency rates. (conversion of energy into luminous flux) than conventional lamps, improves lighting levels within public spaces and reduces visual pollution and light waste. Due to its physical strength and technology, LED lamps have a much longer lifespan (up to 40 times) than conventional incandescent lamps, and can be recycled. the project improves access to electricity, since the energy saved can be distributed to users who currently do not have access to electricity services in homes, businesses and industries. In addition, proper lighting design improves light levels, increases safety, and the city&#39;s aesthetic appeal to residents and visitors. In cooperation with the national government, the local public electricity company (Empresa Electrico de Quito - EEQ) and private stakeholders, in recent years the municipality has rehabilitated and optimized public lighting, focusing efforts on the historic center of Quito , where 2,940 conventional light bulbs have been replaced by efficient lighting systems (LED), with an investment of us$3 million, which implies a reduction in consumption equivalent to us$128,000 per year, which represents the displacement of 715,000 tco2e. The next step of the project is to replace the ornamental public lighting in Quito, located in urban parks and green areas, which means the replacement of 1,756 luminaires concentrated mainly on posts (77%), the ground (17%) and facades (6% ), with a budget of approximately US$1 million. In addition, all conventional spokes in Quito will be replaced."

1564,"smart manholes. intelligent manholesthe daily production of waste is a major problem for large Brazilian cities. although the collection system has undergone considerable improvements in recent years, such as selective collection for example, it often proves to be inefficient. the result of this is the frequent accumulation of non-degradable waste in inappropriate places, such as manholes and storm drains. the clogging of drainage routes reduces the flow of rainwater, causing flooding. when they do not stop at the visit points (culverts), which are part of the city&#39;s sewage network, this garbage is destined for streams and rivers, polluting them and facilitating the overflow of their waters in times of floods. although part of this pollution is due to irregular sewage routes and the lack of sewage treatment, street garbage is also largely responsible for the degradation of streams and rivers. polluted rivers and floods cause inconvenience to the population and traffic, compromising properties and even loss of life. the reef has around 1500 km of galleries and channels that make up the municipality&#39;s drainage system. as it is a city that is practically at sea level, and because it is already experiencing some effects from climate change, the reef suffers from the incidence of flooding in specific posts. when it rains, the situation tends to worsen in these places. an action to clean galleries and gutters recently carried out by the city hall in a single street in a neighborhood of the city showed that in just one day of operation, 45 tons of waste were removed. therefore, it is desirable to apply measures to prevent this waste from reaching the city&#39;s drainage network. known as &quot;intelligent manholes&quot;, the technology offers an efficient solution to solve this problem. it is a filter that is placed in the city&#39;s manholes, presenting itself as physical barriers and preventing the waste from flowing out. coupled to this mechanism, sensors are installed that indicate the volume of garbage retained in the filter. this information is monitored by the city&#39;s urban cleaning company through an application/software, which sends a team responsible for emptying the filter. this technology ensures faster cleaning of manholes, as, with it, workers are able to complete the service in 5 to 10 minutes, while the traditional cleaning method takes 40 to 50 minutes. this fact leads to more manholes being cleaned in a shorter period of time in the city, leading to a reduction in public spending. in addition, due to the nature of the waste that ends up in gutters and manholes being plastic objects, these materials can be sent for proper recycling. Allied to these actions, the city government should carry out environmental awareness and education activities for the population in order to reduce, mainly, the habit of throwing garbage in the streets. for this project, the aim is to apply this technology in a neighborhood in the city of recife, totaling 213 culverts"

1831,"domestic energy efficiency retrofit programme. large scale external fabric retrofit programme - nottingham has around 5,500 solid brick or system built council houses that require external wall insulation and other fabric energy efficiency measures, and could benefit from solar pv on roofs.nottingham has been pioneering approaches utilising modern construction methods, such as panelisation and offsite manufacture through its energiesprong programme, to deliver deep retrofit with high quality, guaranteed performance and low disruption to occupiers. however, these approaches need delivery at scale to truly realise their potential and drive down costs.   a programme at the scale of 1,000 properties per year would be a game changer in driving the development of a new locally-based industry to manufacture and install high quality external wall insulation and other measures, using modern construction methods and offsite manufacture.based on nottingham’s experience, there is currently a funding gap in the order of £25k between the cost of offsite manufacture external fabric measures and the investment that can be justified based on long-term maintenance savings, property value increases and other revenues. this will decrease through economies of scale and innovation in approach.given nottingham’s experience and current programme, and its in-depth knowledge of the supply chain, it is very well place to scale up fast.  our current projects have shown a lack of capacity and capability in the supply chain to deliver the required solutions at a cost effective price point, so our programme will need to start scaling up gradually, with a target of achieving 1000 per year once capacity is built"

2078,"urban drainage. urban drainage is an umbrella project that encompasses (sub) projects that are articulated with each other, having: a. reservoir construction projects; b. bridge raising projects; ec. projects for reviewing structures and construction of new spillways. the growth of urbanization without proper planning results in changes in hydrological processes, such as an increase in surface runoff and a decrease in the natural capacity for retention and infiltration in the soil (doubleday et al., 2013; marchioni; becciu, 2014; elga et al., 2015). this entails several social and environmental impacts, such as the increase in the frequency of floods and the reduction in water availability, due to water contamination (vargas, 1999). these problems are the result of decentralized actions in the basin and, therefore, must also be dealt with at this scale. ahiablame et al. (2012) point to a growing concern in dealing with the problem close to the source of the runoff, in order to reduce and delay flood peaks and also to allow the water table to recharge. existing before urbanization, compensatory techniques in urban drainage gained importance. such techniques can be considered environmentally more appropriate urban solutions for the management of rainwater in urbanized areas and which aim to reduce the impact of increased waterproofing on flood hydrographs (roy et al., 2008)"

The project has 4 lines of work. - Implementation of 10 suds, - Implementation of suds in urban parks and primary roads - Environmental education for the use and exploitation of water, and - Improve the quality of rainwater that recharges the aquifer Two areas were identified for the implementation of the pilot and the executive projects are being carried out for avenues Mérida 2000 and 132. Technical advice is provided by the World Resources Institute (WRI) Mexico. In this line of work, progress has been made from the conceptual idea to the identification of the possible suds to be implemented, the financial sources and mechanism for the operation of the project. State of the financing, there are areas of the city council for the execution of works and maintenance, as well as content image, dissemination and environmental education. each with amounts earmarked for the operation of their functions. For the implementation, a specific amount has been earmarked by the public works department of the city council. For the implementation of the Suds in the Gran Pulmon area, financing and investment mechanisms are being explored with the advice of WRI, Mexico. At this time, the ordinary amounts already allocated are being used, with the expectation of obtaining extraordinary amounts or including these activities in the following year&#39;s budget. project description this project is based on the identification that &quot;water quality&quot; is our main tension for urban resilience and the planning process of the master plan of the green lung of the western area of the city of mérida. In 2017, the urban resilience profile for the city of Mérida was carried out, which identified impacts and tensions that were grouped into 11 priority issues for attention, highlighting the high levels of contamination of the aquifer by anthropogenic activities. In December 2018, the master plan for the great green lung of the city of Mérida was carried out, which is made up of 4 axes of urban intervention: public space, sustainable urban mobility, social coexistence and the environment. The environmental axis proposes developing projects for flora, fauna, solid waste, energy efficiency, water, and environmental education. Regarding water, the implementation of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDs) is proposed, therefore, in April of this year, the Suds project for the great green lung began. The objective is to implement sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDs) such as green ditches, biowater retention areas, rain gardens and permeable floors in urban parks and roads in the area where the &quot;great green lung of the city of Mérida&quot;, as part of the actions aimed at urban water management that allow mitigating the impact of urban development on the aquifer and the problems of quantity / quality of urban runoff. The implementation of the suds will have a high environmental and social impact for 56 thousand homes and more than 122,981 inhabitants (14.8% of total pop.), since it is located in one of the areas with the highest population and housing density, which concentrates urban parks with a high ecological, eco-archaeological and archaeo-botanical value. This project will allow rainwater to be collected, infiltrated and purified by bioremediation, mitigating contamination of the aquifer and favoring its recharge naturally. Improvements have already begun in small neighborhood parks in the area and the preliminary projects for each intervention have been developed. If implemented successfully, these systems can be developed in the rest of the municipality. It has been estimated that the cost for the implementation of 1 sud would be approximately $3,500. There is no total estimate of the project nor the total cost of the investment."

2225,"greater amman municipality (gam) – wadi al tai project for storm water box culvert channel and storage. the main goal of this project is mitigation of flooding risk in wadi al tai in south amman. solutions to capturing and storing storm water are also needed. wadi tai is a valley of approximate length 5 km in the south of amman. it passes through high density residential areas, with many old buildings which are built at the edge of the valley. amman is experiencing changing patterns in its rainfall, with an increase in the severity & intensity of rainstorms, in the winter, which can be attributed to climate change. so these areas are becoming more prone to flooding and many residences suffer from damp and flooded basements during the winter months, due to the volume of water and the insufficiency of the existing drainage system. in february this year severe flooding affected houses, shops and cars. in addition the floods caused the death of a citizen.there has been no comprehensive study of wadi al tai and installation of box culverts has been carried out segmentally at different times according to need and not to any consistent standard. the box culverts in general are not sufficient for the throughput of water during rainstorms and some sections have been left with no drainage system at all in place. there has been no uniformity of alignment or cross-sectional area in construction, which causes a problem of connection between culverts built at different times, and some sections are constructed at the same level as the street and are therefore poorly placed to drain these areas.in jiza, outside the borders of gam, some of the excess water gathers in an open, stone-built tank, which was built hundreds of years ago and is insufficient to store all the storm water. since the wadi is in a very hot arid area much of the water is lost due to evaporation. this is a waste of an extremely precious resource, since amman suffers from a severe lack of water. in fact jordan is one of the most water-deprived countries in the world. this scarcity of water is exacerbated by amman’s rapidly rising population, which has been caused mainly due to the large influx of refugees from surrounding countries, due to conflicts in the region. it has caused the population of amman to rise by more than a million people over the last 5 years. this is placing extreme pressure on amman to provide sufficient potable water for all its inhabitants. solutions for capturing and storing this storm water closer to the city are vital for irrigation & other uses in amman. conserving this storm water could save potable water, currently used for watering and external cleaning, for more important uses as well as enabling the city to provide more greenery in open spaces.gam is planning to carry out this project, which is crucial in making amman a more resilient & green city. it will help defend against future extreme rainstorms & has the potential to save lives & protect against property damage. it will also constitute an important adaptation action, which will help conserve water in amman. it is necessary to make a comprehensive plan for the entire length of the valley which examines alignments, levels and cross-sectional areas and examines the best method of collecting and storing storm water for use in the city.gam is currently planning and studying the first section for construction/ reconstruction of 1.5 km. existing culverts will be provided/ replaced by suitable box culverts.the remaining 3.5 km section is postponed until suitable financing, which is estimated at 4.5 million jd is available"

From this perspective, some water cleaning and treatment technologies were researched and debated as complementary alternatives to basic sanitation. among the researched alternatives, the technology called filtering gardens was identified as appropriate for this context. this technology presents some characteristics considered important for its application in the city. among them, the relatively simple and low-cost management of the systems; the possibility of water treatment systems being inserted as water gardens with landscape qualities; the use and protection of riverside areas as public areas for environmental recovery, avoiding future occupations and environmental risks; and the emission level of greenhouse gases (ghg) significantly lower than other conventional sewage treatment systems. in the context of the reef, what is proposed is to use filtering garden systems in some stretches of polluted streams, but which still have great potential to recover their environmental qualities, and to become leisure areas for the population. The stretches were selected based on the characteristics of the existing streams and their surroundings (type of urban occupation, topography, water flow, etc.), as well as the observed potential to assume role as exemplary interventions for a new standard of urban action in urban streams from the reef. that is, to establish a paradigm shift in the city. In objective terms, the main guideline to be considered here is the break with the still dominant concept that promoted the rectification and waterproofing of a good part of the reef&#39;s creeks as the main way of protecting urbanized areas from floods. in this way, the four areas selected for the installation of filtering gardens comprise the region of the capibaribe park and the jiquiá park, offering improvement of the waters in the capibaribe river, and the jiquiá and tejipió rivers"

2368,"greater amman municipality (gam) - saqef al sel, downtown amman project for reservoir and storm water box culvert channel. this project has two main goals. firstly mitigation of flooding risk in amman & secondly collection & utilization of storm water.mitigation of flooding risk will be addressed by providing a much needed upgrade to the current box culverts, providing drainage for saqf al sel, one of the main valleys in amman, leading to the downtown. excess water runs to the zarqa river & from here to the king talal dam, however much of this water is lost to evaporation on the way.the existing culverts were designed in 1962, over 50 years ago & are not adequate for existing conditions. amman is experiencing changing patterns in its rainfall, with an increase in the severity & intensity of rainstorms, in the winter, which can be attributed to climate change. the situation is exacerbated by changes in the urban area, with the majority of the surrounding hillsides having compact residential development, with few areas where water is able to infiltrate & soak into the surface.the current box culverts’ cross-sectional area of 48m2, allows for a maximum flow of 529m3/s. this is insufficient to handle the sudden increase in throughput of water during intense rainstorms, & this has led, in recent years, to severe flooding of surrounding areas.in february this year severe rainfall caused an estimated maximum flow of 658m3/s, which led to severe flooding in the downtown, effecting businesses & shops, many of which suffered losses due to damage to premises & goods. in addition flooding damaged cars & caused severe congestion & difficulties for commuters in private vehicles, public transport & for pedestrians. this has a carry-on economic effect, since citizens feel they cannot rely on the road network in bad weather & working hours may be shortened when severe rainfall is predicted, with subsequent implications for productivity.this year also flooding was experienced at the roman amphitheater in the downtown. this important archeological & cultural site has been reserved as a unesco registered heritage site, & is a popular tourist attraction. protection of this area is vital.collection & utilization of storm water will be addressed by the provision of a storage reservoir in amman. the site under consideration is under the road running in front of the roman amphitheater, beside the existing culvert. currently there is minimal water storage in the city & insufficient channeling of storm water to reservoirs outside the city, with the result that the majority of the storm water is lost due to evaporation.this is a waste of an extremely precious resource, since amman suffers from a severe lack of water. in fact jordan is one of the most water-deprived countries in the world. this scarcity of water is exacerbated by amman’s rapidly rising population, which has been caused mainly due to the large influx of refugees from surrounding countries, due to conflicts in the region. it has caused the population of amman to rise by more than a million people over the last 5 years. this is placing extreme pressure on amman to provide sufficient potable water for all its inhabitants. storm water collected in the reservoir would be suitable for irrigation & other uses in amman. this could save potable water, currently used for watering and external cleaning, for more important uses as well as enabling the city to provide more greenery in open spaces.gam is planning to carry out this project, which is crucial in making amman a more resilient & green city. it will help defend against future extreme rainstorms & has the potential to save lives & protect against property damage. it will also constitute an important adaptation action, which will help conserve water in amman. gam has carried out preliminary site & hydrological studies. further studies, particularly feasibility study are still needed. timing is a major constraint, since it is vital to complete this project before amman faces further severe rainstorms. the project currently needs funding to proceed"
